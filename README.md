# European Football Injury Impact & Risk Analysis  
**Power BI | SQL | Data Analytics**

> A decision-focused analytics project analyzing **15,600+ football injury records** across Europe’s top leagues to understand **player availability, club-level injury impact, and high-risk player profiles**.

---

## Project Motivation
Injury analysis is often reduced to simple counts.  
This project goes beyond *how many injuries occurred* and focuses on **what actually affects decisions**:
- How much **player availability** is lost?
- Which clubs suffer **high-impact injuries**, not just frequent ones?
- Are players risky due to **frequency**, **severity**, or both?
- How do **age and position** influence recovery duration?

The goal is to translate raw injury data into **actionable insights**.

## Dashboard Structure

### Overview
- Total injuries, total days missed, and average recovery duration  
- League-level comparison of injury burden  
- Clear separation of **injury volume vs severity**

### Club Impact
- Club-level availability loss (days missed)  
- Injury frequency vs impact comparison  
- Player-level risk concentration within each club (interactive slicer)

### Player Risk
- Global Top 20 high-risk players (aggregated across clubs)  
- Age vs injury severity analysis  
- Position × age injury severity heatmap

> Each page is intentionally limited to decision-relevant visuals only — no filler charts.

## Key Insights
- Injury impact varies significantly even among clubs with similar injury counts.  
- A small subset of players accounts for a disproportionate share of availability loss.  
- Injury severity increases with age for certain positions, indicating compounding risk.  
- Managing injury **severity** matters as much as reducing injury **frequency**.

---

## Dataset
- **Records:** 15,602 injury events  
- **Leagues:** Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, Ligue 1  
- **Seasons:** 2020/21 – 2024/25  
- **Granularity:** One row per injury event  

---

## Tools & Skills
- **SQL (MySQL):** data cleaning, validation, aggregations, Top-N analysis  
- **Power BI:** KPI design, multi-page dashboards, slicers, conditional formatting  
- **Analytics:** EDA, KPI definition, business-focused storytelling

## Why This Project Matters
This project demonstrates the ability to:
- Structure analysis from **executive overview → operational impact → individual risk**
- Translate complex data into **clear business insights**
- Design dashboards that prioritize **decisions over decoration**
